=====
* write three programs that all do the same thing!
* all of these programs should:
  * print out the same four lines from your favorite song
  * each line of lyrics should be printed out on a new line
  * for example, if your program prints out the song, 'On a Tropical Island', 
    the output would look like (of course, with three version, imagine this
    three times): 

On a tropical island,
Underneath a molten lava moon.
Hangin' with the hula dancers,
Askin' questions cause' they got all the answers.

* there are multiple ways of printing out strings on new lines:
  * maybe it's just one command
  * or several commands
  * or use different ways of representing strings, putting strings 
    together, or incorporating newlines
* write THREE DIFFERENT versions of this program in this file
